# Life
## Overview

This application is a simulation of human life! The base class Person is extended by the Male and Female classes. Then the Population class maintains a list of the living Persons. Each year, a Person may get married, have a child, or die. You can edit the following simulation parameters in **Life.java**:

1. `popSize`: the initial size of the population
1. `simYears`: the duration of the simulation in years
1. `marriageRate`: the annual marriage rate out of all single adults (i.e. 18+)
1. `birthRate`: the annual birth rate out of all married couples

You can also edit the verbosity of the output via `verbose` in **Util.java**.
